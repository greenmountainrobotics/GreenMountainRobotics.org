    <h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Team 9101 - Chittenden County, VT</strong></h2>
    <p class="par-text">We are Green Mountain Robotics, a FIRST Robotics Competition team based in Burlington, Vermont. This is our first year competing in FRC, but we are a veteran team in FIRST Tech Challenge. We competed in the first off-season event, Week 0, and we are going to be competing in Week 4 at UNH and Week 5 and WPI. Our robot design is built around simplistic ideas and to focus on doing a single job very well instead of trying to do every little part of the competition.</p>
      <p class="par-text">Our team is a collection of highschool students from Essex High School in Essex, Champlain Valley Union in Heinsburg, and South Burlington High School in South Burlignton, and we are based in Burlington, Vermont.</p>
      <p class="par-text">We work at Generator Makerspace in Burlington, and our space there is paid for by BETA Technologies who have graciously given us funding and supplied us with helpful mentors that have taught us CAD, team management skills, and how to solve complex problems.</p>
