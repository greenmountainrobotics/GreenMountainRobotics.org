    <p class="par-text">Our team would like to express our sincere gratitude to our sponsor for their invaluable support over the past year. Their sponsorship has been instrumental in helping us navigate the challenges and uncertainties we faced, ensuring our continued operation and success. Their financial assistance has allowed us to maintain our programs, reach our target audience, and make a meaningful impact in our community. Without their generous contribution, we would not have been able to achieve our goals and maintain our mission. As we look ahead to the future, we are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and the potential for collaboration with other potential sponsors. </p>

      <p class="par-text" style="color: white">BETA Technologies have been one of our best sponsors since our team was created. They have helped in a multitude of ways including mentoring, paying for our space at Generator Makerspace, and helping us fabricate some of our parts. Without BETA we wouldn’t have been able to get through our rookie year and compete at the world championships.</p>

      <p class="par-text">Marvell helped us get through our season by supplying us with lot’s of gracious financial aid when we needed it most throughout the season.
